# Pocket Utils

Many used to be [Gists](https://gist.github.com/dmyersturnbull).
Feel free to import (`pip install littlesnippets`) or just copy and paste.
(A link in your docstring is totally sufficient credit.)

Among the more useful are `zip_strict`, `frozenlist`, `SmartEnum`, `is_lambda`, `strip_paired_brackets`, `sanitize_path_node`, `TomlData`, `PrettyRecordFactory`, `parallel_with_cursor`, `groupby_parallel`, `loop_timing`, and `stream_cmd_call`.

Also has functions for plotting, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
Some of the more useful are `ConfusionMatrix`, `DecisionFrame`, [`PeakFinder`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence), `AtcParser` (for PubChem ATC codes), `WellBase1` (for multiwell plates), and [`TissueTable`]("https://www.proteinatlas.org/).

**WARNING:** The code is there, but there are a few broken imports. Should be fixed by June (2020).
