        Sanitizes a path node such that it will be fine for major OSes and filesystems.
        For example:
        - 'plums;and/or;apples' becomes 'plums_and_or_apples' (escaped ; and /)
        - 'null.txt' becomes '_null_.txt' ('null' is forbidden in Windows)
        - 'abc  ' becomes 'abc' (no trailing spaces)
        The behavior is platform-independent -- os, sys, and pathlib are not used.
        For ex, calling sanitize_path_node(r'C:\') returns r'C:\' on both Windows and Linux
        If you want to sanitize a whole path, see sanitize_path instead.
